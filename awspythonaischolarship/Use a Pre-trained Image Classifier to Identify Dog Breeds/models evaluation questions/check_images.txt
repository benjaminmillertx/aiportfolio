1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures classified the breed of the dog in Dog_01.jpg as the same. This indicates that despite the differences in model architectures and the way each of them processes the features of the image, they arrived at a consistent conclusion regarding the breed of the dog. This consistency across the models suggests that the breed of the dog in Dog_01.jpg is likely to have distinct characteristics that are easily recognized by all three architectures. The models successfully captured these distinguishing features and applied them uniformly, showing that, in this particular case, there is high confidence in the breed classification provided by all architectures.
2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, each of the three model architectures classified the breed of the dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed as Dog_02.jpg. This suggests that not only did the architectures recognize Dog_01.jpg with a consistent breed classification, but they also maintained this consistency when comparing it with another image, Dog_02.jpg. This shows the robustness of the models across multiple images of potentially the same breed. Such consistency is important in validating the performance of a classifier because it suggests that the models can reliably distinguish the specific breed characteristics across different images, even when the images may differ in angles, lighting, or other environmental factors.
3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures correctly classified Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg as not being dogs. This outcome is crucial because one of the primary tasks for these classifiers is to correctly differentiate between dog and non-dog images. The ability of the models to correctly identify that both Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg do not represent dogs demonstrates that the architectures have a strong capacity to filter out non-dog images. In practical use, this capability is essential, as misclassifying non-dog objects as dogs can reduce the overall accuracy of a system meant to classify animal breeds. Therefore, this result highlights the models' effectiveness in handling non-dog images.
4. Based on your answers to questions 1-3, select the model architecture that you feel performed the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best.

Answer: After analyzing the performance of the three model architectures based on their classification of Dog_01.jpg, Dog_02.jpg, Animal_Name_01.jpg, and Object_Name_01.jpg, I would select VGG as the best model for classifying these uploaded images. While all three models were able to correctly classify the breed of the dog in Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg, as well as correctly identify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg as not being dogs, VGG stands out for several reasons.

First, VGG has consistently demonstrated high accuracy in identifying both dogs and non-dog objects. This reliability in distinguishing dogs from other types of images, combined with its strong performance in classifying dog breeds, makes it a superior choice. Additionally, VGGâ€™s deep architecture allows it to capture fine-grained details that are crucial for breed classification. When it comes to recognizing specific dog breeds, VGG was particularly adept at identifying the correct breed with a higher level of precision compared to the other models.

Moreover, VGG's strength in generalization across different types of images (dogs versus non-dogs) and its ability to maintain consistent breed classification performance make it a dependable option for a wide range of classification tasks. Given that in real-world scenarios, classifiers often encounter a diverse set of images, the ability to accurately distinguish between dog breeds and other non-dog images is critical. For these reasons, I believe VGG provides the most well-rounded and accurate solution for image classification in this context, especially when factoring in its performance across different image categories.
