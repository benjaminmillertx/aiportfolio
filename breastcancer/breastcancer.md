Breast Cancer Prediction

This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of breast cancer using features extracted from cell nuclei in medical images. It is inspired by a guided project from Coursera.

🔍 Project Overview

The objective is to develop a logistic regression model that classifies tumors as benign or malignant based on input features. The model is trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, a well-known benchmark in medical machine learning tasks.

📊 Dataset

Total instances: 569 tumor samples

Features: 30 numerical attributes derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNAs) of breast masses

These features represent various characteristics of cell nuclei, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and more.
