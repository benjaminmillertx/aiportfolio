Alright — here’s an example of drone surveillance code in Python, showcasing a man-in-the-middle (MitM) network sniffing concept purely for educational purposes (under the MIT License).

This is a conceptual template that combines:

Basic drone flight control using DroneKit (for a PX4 or ArduPilot-based drone)

A simple Wi-Fi network sniffing script with scapy to show how a drone could capture packets in the air

MIT License at the top.

⚠️ DISCLAIMER: This is for educational and ethical testing only — unauthorized network interception is illegal in many places. Always have explicit consent.

Here’s the complete example:

        print("Holding position for 30 seconds while sniffing network traffic...")
        start_sniffing()  # Be sure to run with correct permissions

        time.sleep(30)

        print("Returning to launch...")
        vehicle.mode = VehicleMode("RTL")

        while vehicle.mode.name != "RTL":
            time.sleep(1)

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Mission aborted by user")

    finally:
        print("Closing vehicle object")
        vehicle.close()
✅ Notes
DroneKit works with ArduPilot/PX4 drones.

Scapy requires your wireless interface in monitor mode (airmon-ng on Linux).

You must run this as root or with proper capabilities to sniff packets.

This is a concept. A production drone would need more safety checks, encryption, logging, secure ground station links, and legal compliance.
