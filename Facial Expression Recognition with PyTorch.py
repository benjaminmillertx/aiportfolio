Facial Expression Recognition with PyTorch

Author: Benjamin Miller

Business Understanding

Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is an increasingly important technology with applications in healthcare, entertainment, security, and more. This project aims to develop a high-accuracy, efficient FER model using the PyTorch framework. The model will be trained on a large dataset of facial expressions to detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and surprise.

The goal is to provide businesses with a tool that can improve customer experiences, enhance security measures, and increase overall operational efficiency. For example:

Healthcare: Detect early signs of depression or anxiety in patients.

Entertainment: Enhance gaming or interactive experiences.

Security: Monitor public spaces for suspicious behavior.

By automating emotion recognition, this project has the potential to transform multiple industries by providing a reliable, scalable, and accurate solution.

Data Understanding

The Face Expression Recognition dataset from Kaggle contains 28,709 labeled grayscale images of human faces, each 48Ã—48 pixels. The dataset includes seven emotion classes: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral.

The dataset is split into:

Training set: 24,706 images

Test set: 4,003 images

Data is stored in CSV format, with each row containing pixel values, emotion labels, and metadata like image usage and intensity. The dataset is generally balanced across emotion classes. Images were preprocessed from FER2013 to include only frontal face poses with appropriate brightness. Some low-resolution images or artifacts remain, which could affect model performance.

Overall, this dataset provides a robust foundation for training and evaluating facial expression recognition models.
